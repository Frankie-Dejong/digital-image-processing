# Digital Image Processing Projects
Here is the code for the course "Digital Image Processing", which contains the code for the following digital image processing projects: 

* Lab1
  * Histogram Equalization 
  * Gray Stretching
    * Linear transformation
    * Logarithmic transformation
    * Multi-linear transformation
    * Gamma correction
* Lab2
  * Fourier Transform

# Usage

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* C++17 or higher
* OpenCV 4.9.0 or higher
* CMake 3.10 or higher

To run the code of each Lab, simply clone the repository and run the following command in the terminal:
